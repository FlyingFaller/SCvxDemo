My attempt so far to implement the Successive Convexification (SCvx) algorithm described in [Successive Convexification: A Superlinearly Convergent Algorithm For Non-Convex Optimal Control Problems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06539). The `demo.ipynb` notebook implements the algorithm as applied to the example problem in Section 5 of the paper. Many liberties have been taken to get the algorithm semi-functional for this problem. There are errors in the code I have yet to fully debug. WIP.
